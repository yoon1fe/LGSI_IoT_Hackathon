> Smart Door lock with Face Identification

Recently, home invasions and burglaries crime make a big social issue. 

It naturally brings up the problem of residential security, 

and we are going to present a solution to prevent strangers from entering the residence by implementing a smart door lock with face identification using AI.


## Scenario
1. When one of the family members enters a password for the door lock, 
the server makes sure that it matches the authorized face and then opens the door.

2. Do not open the door if a person who is unregistered enters the correct password
